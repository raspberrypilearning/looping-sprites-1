## Develop your project
Now it's time to get your first sprite moving. You will start with one sprite and then add more.

To begin to develop your project, you could investigate Butterfly garden and remind yourself how the code works. Click ‘See inside’ to see the Code editor.

You can also look at the [Resources]() for this project for help with coding and other Scratch skills.

Add code to your sprite to make it move the way you want it to. 

Think about the blocks you will need and the order you need to put them in.

Remember to keep running your project to test it. Is the program working as you had planned?

If you have time, duplicate your first sprite to create the starting point for your next sprite and repeat this step.
